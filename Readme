#updateStock

UpdateStock module is compatible with Prestashop 1.7 and its all series and prestashop 1.6.

Please go to prestashop store in backend and install the module zip.

For test the module:

1. When you place any order in that store, after successfully completing of order it will print you json data with product item and quantity. 
This json is result of webhook that use to send the data in inventory management system.
You can check in postman also using this url: http://localhost/prestashop/modules/updateStock/sendStock.php
Raw data: item_id and qty

prestashop will be replace from folder in which you have prestashop.

2. Cron file to test update Prestashop with inventory quantity.
You can test using this url: http://localhost/prestashop/modules/updateStock/cron.php
As we don't have any API, I created a sample json file and use that sample file to update stock in prestashop. Json file name is "sample.json",
you can change data in json and test.

For set the time to run cron on 12 AM, I use the cronjob module of prestashop, when module install, it will add entry in cron job module for 12 AM for this cron.
